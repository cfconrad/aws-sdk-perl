=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::DeleteUser - Arguments for method DeleteUser on Paws::IAM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteUser on the 
AWS Identity and Access Management service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteUser.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteUser.

As an example:

  $service_obj->DeleteUser(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-
